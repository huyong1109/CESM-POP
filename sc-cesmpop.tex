\begin{abstract}
The increasing need for high-resolution climate simulations warrants the investigation of a new preconditioned linear solver for the barotropic mode in the Parallel Ocean Model (POP).  
POP is the ocean component of the Community Earth System Model (CESM) framework and is computationally expensive for high-resolution grids (e.g., 0.1\degree) on many cores.  
Similar to other free-surface models, POP solves the fast barotropic dynamics with the implicit free-surface method.  
This method requires the solution of an elliptic system of equations, and POP solves this elliptic system with a modified Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient (PCG) method.
While effective at moderate core counts and resolutions, PCG methods scale poorly on large parallel systems due to the global reductions required by the inner product calculations.  
This poor scaling is problematic for high-resolution CESM simulations.  
In this work, we implement a more scalable Preconditioned Stiefel Iteration method (P-CSI) into the barotropic mode of POP within CESM, and develop an effective Error Vector Propagation preconditioner to improve the convergence rate.  
Our experiments show that P-CSI accelerates the high-resolution (0.1\degree)  barotropic solver by 7.1 times on 16,875 cores, from 21.84s to 3.06s per simulation day.
This improves the core POP simulation (without I/O and initialization) by 1.74 times, from 5.3 to 9.3 simulated years per wall-clock day.  
Further, to ensure that the use of an alternative solver in POP does not negatively impact the ocean climate, we use an ensemble-based statistical method to evaluate the impact of the new solver.

\section{Conclusion} \label{se:conc}
A scalable and preconditioning supported barotropic solver P-CSI is implemented in POP, the ocean component of the CESM.
The EVP method is used as a preconditioner for both ChronGear and P-CSI, which outperforms diagonal preconditioning in 0.1\degree resolution POP when more than 4,028 cores are used. 
Even though the new barotropic solvers have more benefit in high resolution simulations,
it also contributes to the low resolution simulations. 
The P-CSI solver is verified to maintain a stable ocean climate within a small tolerance using an ensemble based statistical method.
In closing, this paper highlights a scalable and robust barotropic solver for free-surface ocean models.
