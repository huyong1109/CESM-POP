% You need the command \numberofauthors to handle the 'placement

%
% For aesthetic reasons, we recommend 'three authors at a time'

%
% NOTE: You are NOT restricted in how many 'rows' of

%
% Because of the available 'opening page real-estate'
% we ask you to refrain from putting more than six authors
% (two rows with three columns) beneath the article title.
% More than six makes the first-page appear very cluttered indeed.
%
% Use the \alignauthor commands to handle the names
% and affiliations for an 'aesthetic maximum' of six authors.
% Add names, affiliations, addresses for
% the seventh etc. author(s) as the argument for the

%\boldmath
  The increasing need for high-resolution climate simulations warrants
  the investigation of a new preconditioned linear solver for the
  barotropic mode in the Parallel Ocean Model (POP).  POP is the ocean
  component of the Community Earth System Model (CESM) framework and
  is computationally expensive for high-resolution grids (e.g.,
  0.1\degree) on many cores.  Similar to other free-surface models,
  POP solves the fast barotropic dynamics with the implicit
  free-surface method.  This method requires the solution of an
  elliptic system of equations, and POP solves this elliptic system
  with a modified Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient (PCG) method.
  While effective at moderate core counts and resolutions, PCG methods
  scale poorly on large parallel systems due to the global reductions
  required by the inner product calculations.  This poor scaling is
  problematic for high-resolution CESM simulations.  In this work, we
  implement a more scalable Preconditioned Stiefel Iteration method
  (P-CSI) into the barotropic mode of POP within CESM, and develop an
  effective Error Vector Propagation preconditioner to improve the
  convergence rate.  Our experiments show that P-CSI accelerates the
  high-resolution (0.1\degree) barotropic solver by 4.7 times, from
  12.8s to 2.7s per simulation day, on 9,128 cores.  This improves the
  core POP simulation (without I/O and initialization) by 35\%, from
  6.0 to 8.10 simulated years per wall-clock day.  Further, to ensure
  that the use of an alternative solver in POP does not negatively
  impact the ocean climate, we use an ensemble-based statistical
  method to evaluate the impact of the new solver.

\section{Conclusion} \label{se:conc}
A scalable and preconditioning supported barotropic solver P-CSI is implemented in POP, the ocean component of the CESM.
The EVP method is used as a preconditioner for both ChronGear and P-CSI, which outperforms diagonal preconditioning in 0.1\degree resolution POP when more than 4,028 cores are used. 
Even though the new barotropic solvers have more benefit in high resolution simulations,
it also contributes to the low resolution simulations. 
The P-CSI solver is verified to maintain a stable ocean climate within a small tolerance using an ensemble based statistical method.
In closing, this paper highlights a scalable and robust barotropic solver for free-surface ocean models.
